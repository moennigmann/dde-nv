The toolbox in this repository is designed to perform steady state optimizations of delayed systems. Constraints enforce robust asymptotic (or exponential) stability in the presence of uncertain parameters, uncertain delays and state dependent delays.
The development of this toolbox was funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (grant MO 1086/13).



HOW CAN I TEST THIS TOOLBOX VERY QUICKLY?

There are small examples that can be executed with minimal preparation effort. These are located in the folder matlab/delay/demo/. To test them, you need a Matlab installation including a compiler for c-code/mex-files.



WHERE DO I FIND DOCUMENTATION?

The matlab code documentation is based on doxygen. It is located in the subfolder matlab/delay/Documentation. You can update your documentation using the respective makefile.
